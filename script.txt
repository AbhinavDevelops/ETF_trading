Slide 1: Title Slide

Slide 2: Introduction
- we were given historical stock price + volume
- tasked to create a profitable trading strategy
- given an etf and its component stocks, and an etf arbitrage strategy could work
- we felt like we couldn't achieve a profitable strategy, since we didn't have access to all the component stocks
- instead we opted for a technical trading strategy

Slide 3: Technical Trading Strategy
- breakout strategy
    - breakout strategy is a momentum strategy that trades when the price of a stock breaks through a support or resistance level
    - those who believe in momentum see the tendency for rising asset prices to rise further and falling prices to keep falling
    - the monkey idea is that if a stock moves up, it will continue to move up
    - the behavioral finance literature the appearance of momentum is often attributed to cognitive biases from irrational investors such as investor herding, investor over- and under-reaction, and confirmation bias (see Barberis et al., 1998; Daniel et al., 1998).
    - I like to think of it like inertia for stock prices
    
    - to determine our support and resistance levels, we used ORB (Opening Range breakout)
        - the idea behind ORB is that the first n minutes of a day are significant in determining the day's trading range
            - market psychology - the opening range is significant and sets the tone for the day
                - market participatnts have had the night to digest news and events
                - the first n minutes can be a period of significant volatility, volume and price movement as market participants react to the news
            - if the price breaks above the opening range, it is a bullish signal since it shows that the price action is strong and the price is likely to continue to move up
            - if the price breaks below the opening range, it is a bearish signal since it shows that the price action is weak and the price is likely to continue to move down
            - we use a threshold above & below the opening range to filter out noise & action near the resistance / support
    - to measure momentum we used RSI (Relative Strength Index)
        - RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements
        - RSI oscillates between 0 and 100
        - RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30
        - we use a threshold above & below 70 & 30 to filter out noise & action near the resistance / support
        - if the RSI is above 70, it is a bullish signal since it shows that the price action is strong and the price is likely to continue to move up
We wanted to keep our strategy simple and easy to understand since we want to understand what is going on and not just blindly follow a strategy
We chose it because it is simple and easy to understand

Our hyperparamters for entering a trade:
1. the time period for the opening range
2. the threshold above & below the opening range
3. the time period for the RSI
4. the threshold above & below 70 & 30

exiting a trade:
1. we exit a trade when the price crosses the opening range in the opposite direction
2. moving average crossover - we exit a trade when the short term moving average crosses the long term moving average in the opposite direction

Hyperparameter for exiting a trade:
1. the time period for the first moving average
2. the time period for the second moving average


Slide 4: Risk management
1. if volatiltiy is higher, we reduce our position size
2. if we have asymmetric risk, we increase our position size if momentum is in our favor
