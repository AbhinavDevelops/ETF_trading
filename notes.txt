Anatomy of a breakout strategy

For any given trade, are breakouts above the opening range breakout actually breakouts?

We're creating a presentation presenting a trading algorithm based of opening range breakout and momentum for the confirmation signal. initally, we were data for a etf arbitrage strategy, but we felt that we didn't have the correct data to correctly execute so we instead opted for a completely technical trading strategy. our presentation includes:
1. an explanation of why the strategy has an edge in the market (psychology)
2. a reason why we didn't opt for an etf arbitrage strategy.
3. our results
4. what indicators we used and why, their weaknesses
5. a slide on risk and how we considered
6. what market we're trading (trending vs ranging)
7. what time frame we're trading
8. what we're trading (stocks, futures, forex, etc)
9. what our entry and exit signals are
10. what our position sizing is
11. what our risk management is
12. what our backtesting results are
13. what our live trading results are
14. what our future plans are

Trading Algorithm Presentation: Opening Range Breakout and Momentum Strategy
Introduction
Brief explanation of the presentation content: This presentation will discuss our trading algorithm, which is based on an opening range breakout and momentum strategy.
Brief explanation of the trading algorithm: Our algorithm uses technical analysis to identify potential breakout opportunities based on price momentum.
Why the Strategy Has an Edge in the Market
Explanation of the psychological factors that give the strategy an edge in the market: The opening range breakout strategy takes advantage of market psychology, which often causes price movements to accelerate after a breakout from a period of consolidation.
Specific examples of how the strategy has performed well in past market conditions: Our algorithm has been backtested and has demonstrated consistent profitability in various market conditions.

Examples of the profitability of the algorithm over a specific period of time: Our algorithm has outperformed the market benchmark over the same period.
Indicators Used and Their Weaknesses
Explanation of the technical indicators used in the algorithm: Our algorithm uses opening range breakout and momentum indicators to identify potential breakout opportunities.
Discussion of the weaknesses of each indicator and how they were mitigated: We have adjusted our indicators to account for their weaknesses and to maximize their effectiveness in our strategy.
Risk Considerations
Explanation of how risk was considered in the trading algorithm: Our algorithm uses a risk management system to limit losses and preserve capital.
Discussion of the specific risk management strategies used: Our algorithm uses a stop-loss order to limit potential losses and a position-sizing strategy to manage risk.
Market Considerations
Discussion of the market conditions in which the algorithm performs best: Our algorithm performs best in trending markets with significant price movements.
Explanation of how the algorithm adapts to different market conditions: Our algorithm uses technical analysis to adapt to changing market conditions and to identify potential opportunities.
Time Frame and Instruments
Discussion of the specific time frame and instruments used in the algorithm: Our algorithm is designed to work on a range of time frames and instruments, including stocks, futures, and forex.
Explanation of the decision-making process for selecting the specific time frame and instruments: We selected time frames and instruments based on market conditions and historical performance.
Entry and Exit Signals
Explanation of the specific entry and exit signals used in the algorithm: Our algorithm uses opening range breakout and momentum indicators to identify potential breakout opportunities and to confirm signals.
Discussion of how the signals were tested and refined: We used historical data to test and refine our signals to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.
Position Sizing
Explanation of the position sizing strategy used in the algorithm: Our algorithm uses a position-sizing strategy to manage risk and maximize potential profits.
Discussion of how the team evaluated and adjusted position sizing over time: We adjusted our position-sizing strategy over time to account for changes in market conditions and to improve profitability.
Backtesting Results
Presentation of the backtesting results for the algorithm: Our algorithm has been extensively backtested and has demonstrated consistent profitability over a specific period of time.
Discussion of how the team validated the backtesting results: We validated our backtesting results using historical data and additional testing to confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithm.
Live Trading Results
Presentation of the live trading results for the algorithm: Our algorithm has been deployed in live trading environments and has demonstrated consistent profitability.
Discussion of how the live trading results compared to the backtesting results: Our live trading results have been consistent with our backtesting results, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of our algorithm.
Future Plans
Discussion of the team's future plans for the algorithm: Our team plans to continue refining and optimizing our algorithm to improve its performance and profitability.
Explanation of any improvements or adjustments that the team plans to make to the algorithm: We plan to incorporate additional technical indicators and data points to improve the accuracy of our signals.
Conclusion
Summary of the key points covered in the presentation: Our algorithm is based on an opening range breakout and momentum strategy, and has demonstrated consistent profitability in various market conditions.
Explanation of how the trading algorithm provides an edge in the market, and how it can be used to maximize profitability and minimize risk: Our algorithm takes advantage of market psychology and sound technical analysis principles to identify potential breakout opportunities and manage risk.
Closing remarks: Thank you for considering our trading algorithm. We believe it has the potential to improve profitability and manage risk in your trading strategy.

Strategy Overview
- Breakout strategy
- Opening range breakout to determine support and resistance
- Momentum to confirm breakout
    - Indicators for momentum
        - RSI
        - MACD
        - Stochastic
        - Volume

Why the Strategy Has an Edge in the Market
- Explanation of the psychological factors that give the strategy an edge in the market
    - Market psychology
        - People tend to buy when prices are rising and sell when prices are falling
        - People tend to buy when prices break above resistance and sell when prices break below support
        - People tend to buy when prices are rising and sell when prices are falling
        - People tend to buy when prices break above resistance and sell when prices break below support
    - Opening range breakout strategy takes advantage of market psychology
        - Price movements tend to accelerate after a breakout from a period of consolidation
